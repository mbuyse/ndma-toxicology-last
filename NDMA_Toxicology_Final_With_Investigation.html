    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Uses and Exposure</h2>
        <p>NDMA is widely found in the environment due to natural and industrial processes. It is a byproduct of water disinfection using chloramines, leading to contamination in drinking water.</p>
        <p>It is also present in processed foods such as cured meats, smoked fish, and alcoholic beverages like beer and whiskey. NDMA contamination in pharmaceuticals has led to recalls, including drugs like ranitidine and valsartan.</p>
        <p>Other sources include tobacco smoke and industrial emissions from rubber and chemical manufacturing plants.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>NDMA's chemical properties contribute to its toxicity. Its high water solubility makes it difficult to remove from contaminated sources. The compound is highly reactive and can easily form carcinogenic byproducts.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Health Effects</h2>
        <p>NDMA is a potent hepatotoxin and carcinogen. The liver is the primary target organ, where NDMA metabolism leads to oxidative stress, DNA damage, and increased cancer risk.</p>
        <p>It is linked to liver, lung, and gastrointestinal cancers. Acute exposure at high doses can lead to severe liver necrosis, while chronic exposure, even at low levels, increases the likelihood of tumor formation.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Mechanism of Toxicity</h2>
        <p>Once absorbed, NDMA is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, in the liver. This process generates highly reactive intermediates, such as methyl diazonium ion, which can bind to DNA and proteins.</p>
        <p>DNA adduct formation, specifically O6-methylguanine, interferes with normal replication, leading to mutations, chromosomal instability, and potential tumor formation.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Scientific Research</h2>
        <p>Studies in rodents show that NDMA exposure leads to rapid hepatocellular necrosis and the formation of liver tumors. The LD₅₀ (oral, rats) is 30–40 mg/kg.</p>
        <p>Chronic exposure to as low as 1 mg/kg/day for months has resulted in liver tumors, lung cancer, and kidney damage in rodents. Human epidemiological studies associate long-term exposure (0.1–10 ppb in water) with increased liver cancer rates.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
        <h2>Regulations</h2>
        <p>Due to its high carcinogenic potential, NDMA is heavily regulated. The EPA has set a drinking water limit of 0.7 ng/L, while the FDA has enforced strict controls on pharmaceutical contamination.</p>
        <p>Despite regulatory efforts, ongoing industrial pollution and dietary sources continue to pose risks.</p>
    </section>

    
<section>
    <h2>Most Common Present and Recent Past Uses of NDMA</h2>
    <p>NDMA is not intentionally manufactured for commercial purposes due to its high toxicity. However, it has historically been used in limited industrial and research applications, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Research reagent in laboratory settings to induce liver cancer in animal models for carcinogenic studies.</li>
        <li>Intermediate in rubber and pesticide manufacturing, particularly as a byproduct in the synthesis of certain chemicals.</li>
        <li>Rocket fuel additive and byproduct in the production of 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) used in aerospace industries.</li>
        <li>Contaminant in pharmaceuticals, particularly ranitidine, valsartan, and other angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), due to chemical instability during manufacturing or storage.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In recent years, its presence as an unintended contaminant has raised significant public health concerns, especially in pharmaceuticals and drinking water.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Opportunities for Exposure to NDMA</h2>
    <p>Opportunities for exposure to NDMA occur through multiple environmental and occupational pathways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drinking Water:</strong> NDMA is a disinfection byproduct formed during chloramination (a common method of water treatment using chloramine instead of chlorine).</li>
        <li><strong>Dietary Intake:</strong> NDMA is found in cured meats, smoked fish, beer, whiskey, and cheese due to nitrite preservation processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Pharmaceuticals:</strong> Contamination in medications like ranitidine and certain ARBs has led to consumer exposure through long-term use.</li>
        <li><strong>Tobacco Smoke:</strong> Both active and passive smoking expose individuals to nitrosamines, including NDMA.</li>
        <li><strong>Occupational Exposure:</strong> Workers in rubber manufacturing, pesticide production, and aerospace industries may encounter NDMA or related precursors.</li>
        <li><strong>Geographical Risk:</strong> Exposure is higher in industrial areas, regions using chloraminated water, and places with less stringent pharmaceutical controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Physical and Chemical Properties of NDMA That Impact Its Toxicity</h2>
    <p>NDMA's toxicity is significantly influenced by its chemical structure, reactivity, and metabolic activation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Metabolic Activation:</strong> NDMA is a procarcinogen activated by cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), producing methyl diazonium ions that form DNA adducts, particularly O6-methylguanine.</li>
        <li><strong>High Water Solubility:</strong> 290 g/L at 25°C, enhancing mobility in water and persistence in groundwater and drinking water.</li>
        <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Boiling point of 151°C allows volatilization from water and soil, contributing to airborne exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Chemical Reactivity:</strong> Contains an N–N=O group, making it capable of forming damaging nitrosating agents.</li>
        <li><strong>Structural Simplicity:</strong> Small, nonpolar structure aids absorption through skin, lungs, and GI tract, supporting multiple exposure routes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scientific Investigation</h2>
    <p>An insightful experimental investigation into the carcinogenic effects of N-nitrosamines, including N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), is presented in the study by Berger et al. (1990), titled <em>"Implications of the Carcinogenic Hazard of Low Doses of Three Hepatocarcinogenic N‐Nitrosamines"</em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1349-7006.1990.tb02615.x">【Berger et al., 1990】</a>. This article explores the dose-response relationship and tumorigenic potential of three nitrosamines, with a specific focus on low-dose exposures, which are more relevant to environmental and dietary human exposures.</p>

    <p>A particularly interesting experiment within the study involved the oral administration of NDMA to female Sprague-Dawley rats over a period of six weeks. The rats received repeated low doses of NDMA—ranging from 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg body weight—to mimic chronic environmental exposure. The researchers then observed the animals over a long latency period of 84 weeks to monitor the development of hepatic tumors. Histopathological analysis revealed that even these very low doses of NDMA were sufficient to induce preneoplastic liver lesions and hepatocellular carcinomas in a dose-dependent manner.</p>

    <p>The experimental approach included not only the administration of NDMA but also a comparative analysis with other structurally similar nitrosamines (N-nitrosodiethylamine and N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine), allowing the researchers to investigate whether differences in molecular structure influenced carcinogenic potency. Notably, NDMA was found to be the most potent among the three tested compounds. This finding emphasized the high sensitivity of liver tissue to NDMA-induced DNA damage, likely due to its efficient metabolic activation by hepatic CYP450 enzymes, particularly CYP2E1, which converts NDMA into methylating intermediates that alkylate DNA bases such as guanine.</p>

    <p>The study provides strong evidence for a non-threshold mechanism of action, suggesting that even minimal exposure to NDMA may carry carcinogenic risk due to the cumulative nature of DNA damage and the lack of a safe exposure level. This insight underscores the importance of stringent regulation and surveillance of NDMA contamination in food, water, and pharmaceuticals. The findings from this experiment contribute significantly to our understanding of NDMA's mechanism of toxicity, which involves genotoxic DNA adduct formation, mutagenesis, and eventual tumor initiation, particularly in hepatic tissue.</p>

    <p>By examining this original research article, it becomes clear that experimental animal models play a crucial role in elucidating the biological processes underlying chemical-induced carcinogenesis, thereby informing public health decisions and regulatory standards.</p>
